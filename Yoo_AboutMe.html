          <figcaption class="figure-caption">Hello!, my name is Adrian Yoo who is currently rolling in CSP class in Dublin High School. I'm a Sophomore who wants to become an engineer to participate in NASA as a robotic engineer. I'm 16 years old and I've been lived in Korea for 10 years when I was 3 years old, and came back to U.S. I learned how to play guitar, chess, Go game, golf, and soccer. I also participated in Video Production when I was in middle school.

          <p class="font-size">A Chinese philosopher, Confucius, said, "Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life." My current career goal is becoming a robotic or mechanical engineer and getting into NASA because when I was young, I really liked to build robots in Robotic Club and LEGO. My plan is studying the basic knowledges about engineering in Dublin High School and learn major knowledges during the college years.</p> 
          <br>
          <p class="font-size">There are many characteristcs or experiences that relate to this career, but if I have to say specifically I will possess creative, supportive, and experienced. I possess creative because being intelligent might be important for studying, but being creative helps me to learn new things and be innovative in curruculum. It also gave me opportunities to try out new ideas, ways of thinking, and problem-solving in school. Supportive is similar as a teamwork. I learned that if I can't be supportive to my teammate I will never be successful in group work because team sports need a collaboration including the projects that I did in CSP since I knew that I can't solve problems just by myself. Finally, having more experience is really important because everyone learn from his or her mistakes and use the knowledge to become better, so he or she won't make the same mistake. I learned that if I don't make any mistake, I won't learn nothing, and if I don't learn anything, I won't change.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Some of my major accomplishments in high school were getting straight A or 4.0 for all semester throughout Sophomores and Freshmen, chosen as a team ambassador in golf team, and over 20 hours of volunteering currently. I have participated in school golf team, soccer team as an outside club, Speech & Debate, Drawing, Video Production, etc. I learned that I'm very hard working when I took a difficult class, supportive when I'm in the sports team, and very humorous especially when I talk and work with different type of people. I don't have any work experience yet except some volunteer works, which taught me a lesson why people pay money when he or she works at a company or work place.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Overall, my career goal is becoming an engineer that related to mechanic, which it requires to have creative, supportive, and some experiences from my high school years and accomplishments, and always try my best on everything I participate in.</p>
