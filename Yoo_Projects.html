        <p>For this project, my team decided to create a Maze Game that will be more complicated to escape as the player passes the levels. Both of us were not really comfortable in Scratch and committed that our skill was a begginer skill, so we chose to make a simple game that would be useful and essential to play. As more game produced, many games need a strategy to win a game and have to think hard especially when an online player is fighting against the other online player. My specific role was programming the codes include designing the map for Maze Game. I decided to create a map by using the grids and a yellow ball for the character. Then, I started to create a code that can move a sprite by using arrows and a code that will change the background as you go over the screen, which it brought me a challenge. I noticed that when a sprite tried to go back to the previous map, the background didn't show the previous map of the player's current background instead it showed a map of another random maze. To solve this challenge, I reorganized the codes to find an error and slowly oberserved if the code was in the correct form. As I checked each code throughout, I noticed that I didn't add a code that switches background and should run when the background switched to another background, so I added that code to the background coding section. As soon as I ran the code again, it fluently switched the map correctly when the sprite went at the end of the background. After I finished this project, I learned the basic structures of how to program games or stories, and how to work as a team. One of thing that made us successful at this project was communication and responsibility for each own work. Almost everyday, we kept talking to each other on the phone about what we are currently working on, what problems we have, how much work have each of us done, or how we are going to make our game better. When we met in class, we gave some feedbacks to each other in order to make our game the best. We received a good score on this project because of our responsibility for our own work. I had a responsiblity to create and edit our game as a programmer. My parter had a responsibility to organize what we have done on each day and explain what our game is about on this project's notebook.</p>
